# Phenotyping Analysis: Pearl Millet Panicles

**Project Duration**: Nov 2021 - Feb 2022  
**Organization**: University of Massachusetts Boston  

## Overview  
Using the **PlantCV library**, I automated measurement extraction from Pearl millet panicle images. This project demonstrated how automation could enhance agricultural research and food security through improved monitoring of millet breeding programs.

## Objectives  
- Automate phenotypic trait extraction for Pearl millet panicles.  
- Improve agricultural monitoring efficiency for millet-dependent regions.

## Technologies  
- **Python**  
- **PlantCV**  

## Outcomes  
- Increased monitoring efficiency by 80%.  
- Presented results at the Sixth CSM Student Success Showcase.
